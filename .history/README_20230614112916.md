## What I Learned

  1. Project Architecture
  2.

## Errors I Faced

  1. "fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git" - This error was caused by the fact that I had exported a CDPATH environment variable, and one of the sub-directories of a repo happens to be named same as another non-repo-subdir under one of the paths in my CDPATH, and git was trying to find the repo in the non-repo-subdir. To fix this, I had to unset the CDPATH environment variable.
